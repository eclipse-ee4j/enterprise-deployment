/**
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager class is a central registry for
 * Jakarta EE DeploymentFactory objects.  The DeploymentFactoryManager
 * retains references to DeploymentFactory objects loaded by
 * a tool.  A DeploymentFactory object provides a reference to
 * a DeploymentManager.
 *
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager has been implemented as a singleton.
 * A tool gets a reference to the DeploymentFactoryManager via the
 * getInstance method.
 *
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager can return two types of
 * DeploymentManagers, a connected DeploymentManager and a
 * disconnected DeploymentManager.  The connected DeploymentManager
 * provides access to any product resources that may be required
 * for configurations and deployment.  The method to retrieve a
 * connected DeploymentManager is getDeploymentManager. This method
 * provides parameters for user name and password that the  product
 * may require for user authentication.  A disconnected DeploymentManager
 * does not provide access to a running Jakarta EE product. The method
 * to retrieve a disconnected DeploymentManager is
 * getDisconnectedDeploymentManager.  A disconnected DeploymentManager
 * does not need user authentication information.
