/**
 * A Jakarta EE component module consists of one or more deployment
 * descriptor files and zero or more non-deployment descriptor 
 * XML instance documents.  A module must contain a component-specific 
 * deployment descriptor file (see the component specification for 
 * details). It may contain one or more secondary deployment descriptor 
 * files that define extra functionality on the component and zero or more 
 * non-deployment descriptor XML instance documents (see the Web Services 
 * specification).
 *
 * <p>
 * The DConfigBeanRoot object is a deployment configuration bean 
 * (DConfigBean) that is associated with the root of the component's 
 * deployment descriptor. It must be created by calling the 
 * DeploymentConfiguration.getDConfigBean(DDBeanRoot) method, where 
 * DDBeanRoot represents the component's deployment descriptor.
 *
 * <p>
 * A DConfigBean object is associated with a deployment descriptor 
 * that extends a component's functionality.  It must be created by 
 * calling the DConfigBeanRoot.getDConfigBean(DDBeanRoot) method. This 
 * DConfigBean object is a child of the compontent's DConfigBeanRoot 
 * object.  The DDBeanRoot argument represents the secondary deployment 
 * descriptor.  Deployment  descriptor files  such as webservice.xml and 
 * webserviceclient.xml are examples of secondary deployment descriptor 
 * files.
 *
 * <p>
 * The server plugin must request a DDBeanRoot object for any non-deployment 
 * descriptor XML instance document data it requires.  The plugin must 
 * call method DeployableObject.getDDBeanRoot(String) where String is the 
 * full path name from the root of the module to the file to be represented. 
 * A WSDL file is an example of a non-deployment descriptor XML instance 
 * document.
