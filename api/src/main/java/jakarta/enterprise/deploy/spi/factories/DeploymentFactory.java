/**
 * The DeploymentFactory interface is a deployment driver for a
 * Jakarta EE plaform product.  It returns a DeploymentManager object
 * which represents a connection to a specific Jakarta EE platform
 * product.
 *
 * <p> Each application server vendor must provide an implementation
 *  of this class in order for the Jakarta Deployment to work
 *  with their product.
 *
 * <p> The class implementing this interface should have a public
 * no-argument constructor, and it should be stateless (two instances
 * of the class should always behave the same).  It is suggested but
 * not required that the class have a static initializer that registers
 * an instance of the class with the DeploymentFactoryManager class.
 *
 * <p> A connected or disconnected DeploymentManager
 * can be requested.  A DeploymentManager that runs connected to the
 * platform can provide access to Jakarta EE resources. A DeploymentManager
 * that runs disconnected only provides module deployment configuration
 * support.
