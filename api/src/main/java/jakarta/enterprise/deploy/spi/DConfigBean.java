/**
 * The DConfigBean is a deployment configuration bean (DConfigBean)
 * that is associated with one or more deployment descriptor beans, 
 * (DDBean). A DConfigBean represents a logical grouping of deployment 
 * configuration data to be presented to the Deployer.  A DConfigBean
 * provides zero or more XPaths that identifies the XML information 
 * it requires.  A DConfigBean may contain other DConfigBeans and 
 * regular JavaBeans.  The top most DConfigBean is a DConfigBeanRoot 
 * object which represents a single XML instance document.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A DConfigBean is created by calling DConfigBean.getDConfigBean(DDBean)
 * method, where DConfigBean is the object that provided the XPath which 
 * the DDBean represents.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A DConfigBean is a JavaBean component that presents the dynamic 
 * deployment configuration information for a Jakarta EE plugin to the deployer.
 * It is a JavaBean.  The JavaBean architecture was chosen because
 * of its versatility in providing both simple and complex components.
 * JavaBeans also enable the development of property sheets and property
 * editors, as well as sophisticated customization wizards.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is expected that a plugin vendor will provide a Property Editor 
 * for any complex datatype in a DConfigBean that a deployer needs to edit
 * through a property sheet.  The Property Editor should be implemented 
 * and made available to a tool according to the guidelines defined in the 
 * JavaBeans API Specification version 1.01.
